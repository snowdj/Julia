Installing on Windows systems

Download the julia Windows binary from this link.
Open up the resulting archive and double-click on "julia." (This is a batch script named julia.bat.)

When prompted by popup windows, click "Extract All" and then "Extract."

Enter the extracted directory (julia-d8a5dc1753) and again double-click on "julia" (again, the julia.bat script).

This should bring up the julia> prompt.

At the julia prompt, type

       julia> Pkg.add("Winston")
      
You will be prompted to enter your name and password.

You will be prompted twice with a question whose possible responses are skip, binary, source. Enter binary.

This will proceed to do various things for a while (massive quantities of text will scroll over your screen).

When it finishes, you will be returned to the julia> prompt. Type

       julia> using Winston;
       julia> plot([1:10],[1:10]);
      
This should create a plot of a line.
