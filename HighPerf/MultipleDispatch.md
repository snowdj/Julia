Multiple dispatch or multimethods is the feature of some object-oriented programming languages in which a function or method can be dynamically dispatched based on the run time (dynamic) type of more than one of its arguments.[1] This is an extension of single dispatch polymorphism where a method call is dynamically dispatched based on the actual derived type of the object on which the method has been called. Multiple dispatch generalizes the dynamic dispatching to work with a combination of two or more objects.
