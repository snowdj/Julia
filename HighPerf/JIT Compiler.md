High-Performance JIT Compiler
==================================
Julia’s LLVM-based just-in-time (JIT) compiler combined with the language’s design allow it to approach and often match the performance of C. To get a sense of relative performance of Julia compared to other languages that can or could be used for numerical and scientific computing, we’ve written a small set of micro-benchmarks in a variety of languages: C, Fortran, Julia, Python, Matlab/Octave, R, JavaScript, Go, and Mathematica. 
We encourage you to skim the code to get a sense for how easy or difficult numerical programming in each language is.
