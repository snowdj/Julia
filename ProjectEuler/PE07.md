Project Euler Question 7
============================
- By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.
- What is the 10001st prime number?

#### Using the `primes` function
<pre><code>
function main(n)

N=10
println(size(primes(N))[1])
while (size(primes(N))[1])<10000
	N = N*10
	end
primes(N)[10001]
</code></pre>
