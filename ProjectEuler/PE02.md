Project Euler Question 2
========================

- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
- By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: *1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...*

- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


<pre><code>
function main()
    i = 1
    j = 1
    tot = 0
    while j <= 4000000
        next = i + j
        i = j
        j = next
        if mod(j, 2) == 0
            tot += j
        end
    end
    println(tot)
end

println(@elapsed main())
