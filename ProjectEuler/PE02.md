Project Euler Question 2
========================

- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be: *1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...*

- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


<pre><code>
function main(N)
	function fib_ans(n::Int64)
		term1 = 1
		term2 = 1
		next = 0
		summ = 0
		while term1 <= n
			next = term1 + term2
			if next%2 ==0
				summ += next
			end
			term1 = term2
			term2 = next
		end
		return summ
	end
	println("The answer is: ", fib_ans(N))
end
println(@elapsed main(4000000))
println(@elapsed main(4000000))
</code></pre>
