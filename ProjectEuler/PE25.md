Project Euler Question 25
============================
- The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:
- Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.
- Hence the first, second, third, 11th and 12th terms will be:
 - F1 = 1
 - F2 = 1
 - F3 = 2
 - F11 = 89
 - F12 = 144
- The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.
- What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?
