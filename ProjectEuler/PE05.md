Project Euler Question 5
=============================
- 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

- What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#### The `lcm` command
 
<pre><code>
lcm(m,n)
</code></pre>

#### Solution
<pre><code>
function main()
	println("The answer is: ", lcm([1:20]...))
end

println(@elapsed main())
println(@elapsed main())
</code></pre>
