Project Euler Question 5
=============================
- 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

- What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#### The `lcm` command
- This command computes the least common multiple of two integers.
- Given m and n, the least common multiple is the smallest positive integer that has both m and n as factors. 
- For example, the least common multiple of 12 and 18 is 36, because 12 is a factor (12 × 3 = 36), and 18 is a factor (18 × 2 = 36), and there is no positive integer less than 36 that has both factors. 
- As a special case, if either m or n is zero, then the least common multiple is zero. 
<pre><code>
lcm(m,n)
</code></pre>

#### Solution
<pre><code>
function main()
	println("The answer is: ", lcm([1:20]...))
end

println(@elapsed main())
println(@elapsed main())
</code></pre>
